# Introduction
This repository will contain work for my third year Server Side RAD project in computing Software Development studied at GMIT. I am required to write a Spring Boot MVC (Model View Controller) application that allows a logged-in user to manage orders of products for customers. The application will use the Spring MVC n-tier architecture i.e. Controllers, Services, Repositories, Views, with the appropiate data/logic in each tier.

# Model
The Model for the application consists of three objects:
+ Product
  - Product ID
  - Description
  - Quantity In Stock
+ Customer
  - CustomerID
  - Customer Name
+ Order
  - Order ID
  - Order Quantity
  - Order Date
